# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/sp.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Implementation of a secure, robust FastAPI backend for the Todo Full-Stack Web Application with SQLModel ORM for Neon Serverless PostgreSQL. The backend provides all 6 RESTful API endpoints for task CRUD operations with JWT-based authentication verification integrated with Better Auth from the frontend. User data isolation is enforced through filtering all queries by authenticated user_id extracted from JWT tokens, ensuring no data leakage between users. The implementation follows spec-driven methodology with agentic development using Claude Code, adhering to the technology stack of FastAPI, SQLModel, Neon PostgreSQL, and PyJWT as specified in the feature requirements.

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: Python 3.11+
**Primary Dependencies**: FastAPI, SQLModel, PyJWT, python-dotenv, uvicorn
**Storage**: Neon Serverless PostgreSQL database with SQLModel ORM
**Testing**: Manual API testing with Postman/Thunder Client, integration testing with frontend
**Target Platform**: Linux/Unix server environment (local development and deployment)
**Project Type**: Web backend API service
**Performance Goals**: API endpoints respond within 500ms for 95% of requests under normal load conditions, handle 1000 concurrent users
**Constraints**: Technology locked (FastAPI, SQLModel, Neon PostgreSQL, PyJWT), JWT authentication with Better Auth integration, user data isolation enforcement, all routes under /api/ prefix
**Scale/Scope**: Multi-user Todo application supporting secure task management with proper user isolation

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

1. **Fully Spec-Driven and Agentic Development**: ✅ PASS - All development will follow spec-driven methodology with implementation generated via Claude Code agents using references to @specs/api/rest-endpoints.md, @specs/database/schema.md, @specs/agents/task-agent.md, @specs/agents/auth-agent.md

2. **Zero Manual Coding Mandate**: ✅ PASS - Implementation will be generated exclusively through Claude Code agents using /sp.implement and related skills, with all code traceable to specification requirements

3. **Modular Architecture Through Agents and Skills**: ✅ PASS - Using dedicated agents: Task Agent for CRUD operations, Auth Agent for JWT authentication, with clear interfaces between components

4. **Complete User Isolation and Data Ownership**: ✅ PASS - All database queries will be filtered by authenticated user_id, enforcing task ownership with no cross-user data access permitted

5. **Strict Technology Stack Adherence**: ✅ PASS - Implementation will use exactly the specified stack: FastAPI, SQLModel, Neon Serverless PostgreSQL, PyJWT for authentication

6. **Stateless Authentication with JWT**: ✅ PASS - Authentication will be completely stateless using JWT tokens only, verifying tokens with BETTER_AUTH_SECRET, with no session storage on backend

```

**Structure Decision**: Selected web application backend structure with dedicated backend/ directory for FastAPI application. This structure separates the backend API from the frontend (which is in the main project root) and follows the requirements for a FastAPI + SQLModel + Neon PostgreSQL backend service.
