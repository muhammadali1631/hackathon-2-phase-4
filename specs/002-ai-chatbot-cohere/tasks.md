# Implementation Tasks: AI Todo Chatbot Integration (Cohere-Powered)

**Feature**: AI Todo Chatbot Integration (Cohere-Powered)
**Branch**: `002-ai-chatbot-cohere`
**Spec**: specs/002-ai-chatbot-cohere/spec.md
**Plan**: specs/002-ai-chatbot-cohere/plan.md

## Implementation Strategy

This implementation follows a phased approach where each user story results in a complete, independently testable increment. The strategy prioritizes delivering core functionality early (MVP) with subsequent enhancements for a polished experience.

- **MVP Scope**: User Story 1 (Natural Language Task Management) with minimal UI
- **Incremental Delivery**: Each user story builds upon the previous with additional functionality
- **Parallel Execution**: Where possible, tasks are marked [P] to allow parallel development
- **Independent Testing**: Each user story can be tested independently once completed

## Phase 1: Setup & Environment

- [x] T001 Create COHERE_API_KEY environment variable in backend/.env
- [x] T002 Install cohere-python SDK in backend requirements.txt and pip install
- [x] T003 Update backend Alembic migration to include Conversation and Message models
- [x] T004 Create frontend chat API service file at frontend/src/services/chatApi.ts
- [ ] T005 [P] Add COHERE_API_KEY to backend configuration loading

## Phase 2: Foundational Components

- [x] T010 Create Conversation model in backend/src/models/conversation.py with id, user_id, title, created_at, updated_at, is_active
- [x] T011 Create Message model in backend/src/models/message.py with id, conversation_id, role, content, tool_calls, tool_call_results, created_at
- [x] T012 [P] Create ChatService in backend/src/services/chat_service.py for conversation management
- [x] T013 [P] Create ToolsService in backend/src/services/tools_service.py for MCP-compatible tools
- [x] T014 [P] Update User model in backend/src/models/user.py with last_chat_interaction field
- [x] T015 [P] Create CohereRunner class in backend/src/services/chat_service.py for AI integration

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Natural Language Task Management [US1]

**Goal**: Enable users to manage todos using natural language commands like "Add task buy milk" or "Show pending tasks".

**Independent Test Criteria**: Send natural language commands to the chatbot and verify that appropriate task operations are performed, delivering the core conversational interface value.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:
1. Given I'm logged in and see the chatbot UI, When I type "Add task buy milk", Then a new task "buy milk" is created and I receive confirmation
2. Given I have existing tasks, When I type "Show pending tasks", Then I see a list of my pending tasks in the chat
3. Given I have a task with ID 5, When I type "Complete task 5", Then the task is marked complete and I receive confirmation
4. Given I have multiple tasks, When I type "Delete the old one", Then the oldest task is deleted and I receive confirmation

**Independent Test Criteria**: Log in and verify the chatbot icon appears, clicking it opens the chat window, delivering accessibility value.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:
1. Given I'm logged in, When I visit any page, Then I see a floating chatbot icon in the bottom-right corner
2. Given I see the chatbot icon, When I click it, Then a chat window opens with a clean, modern interface
3. Given I have an open chat window, When I click outside it, Then the window closes without losing conversation context

## Dependencies Between User Stories

- **US2 depends on US1**: Profile access requires the foundational chat infrastructure
- **US3 depends on US1**: Conversation persistence builds on the basic chat functionality
- **US4 depends on US1**: UI enhancements require the underlying chat functionality to work

## Parallel Execution Opportunities

- **Services Layer**: ToolsService and ChatService can be developed in parallel [P tasks]
- **Frontend Components**: ChatWindow and ChatbotIcon can be developed in parallel [P tasks]
- **UI Polish**: Styling and animations can be added in parallel once core functionality exists [P tasks]
- **Testing**: Unit tests can be written in parallel with implementation [P tasks]

## Test Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: Individual service functions and tool implementations
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end chat functionality with Cohere integration
- **UI Tests**: Chat interface interactions and state management
- **Security Tests**: Authentication and user data isolation validation
- **Performance Tests**: Response times and message history handling
