# Feature Specification: AI Todo Chatbot Integration (Cohere-Powered)

**Feature Branch**: `002-ai-chatbot-cohere`
**Created**: 2026-02-04
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Phase III AI Todo Chatbot - Build and integrate a powerful, natural-language Todo AI Chatbot into the existing Next.js + FastAPI full-stack application using Cohere as the LLM backend. The chatbot must fully control task CRUD operations and provide user profile information via natural language."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

<!--
  IMPORTANT: User stories should be PRIORITIZED as user journeys ordered by importance.
  Each user story/journey must be INDEPENDENTLY TESTABLE - meaning if you implement just ONE of them,
  you should still have a viable MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that delivers value.

  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each story, where P1 is the most critical.
  Think of each story as a standalone slice of functionality that can be:
  - Developed independently
  - Tested independently
  - Deployed independently
  - Demonstrated to users independently
-->

### User Story 1 - Natural Language Task Management (Priority: P1)

As a logged-in user, I want to manage my todos using natural language commands like "Add task buy milk" or "Show pending tasks" so that I can interact with the app conversationally without clicking through UI elements.

**Why this priority**: This is the core value proposition of the chatbot - enabling natural language interaction with the todo system, which is the primary reason for building this feature.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by sending natural language commands to the chatbot and verifying that appropriate task operations are performed, delivering the core conversational interface value.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I'm logged in and see the chatbot UI, **When** I type "Add task buy milk", **Then** a new task "buy milk" is created and I receive confirmation
2. **Given** I have existing tasks, **When** I type "Show pending tasks", **Then** I see a list of my pending tasks in the chat
3. **Given** I have a task with ID 5, **When** I type "Complete task 5", **Then** the task is marked complete and I receive confirmation
4. **Given** I have multiple tasks, **When** I type "Delete the old one", **Then** the oldest task is deleted and I receive confirmation

### User Story 2 - User Profile Information Access (Priority: P2)

As a logged-in user, I want to ask for my profile information using natural language like "Mera email kya hai?" or "Who am I?" so that I can quickly access my account details through the chat interface.

**Why this priority**: Enhances the conversational experience by allowing users to get account information without navigating to profile pages, improving the chatbot's utility.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by asking profile-related questions and verifying that correct user information (id, email, name, createdAt) is returned, delivering the profile access value.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I'm logged in, **When** I ask "Mera email kya hai?", **Then** I receive my email address in the response
2. **Given** I'm logged in, **When** I ask "Who am I?", **Then** I receive my name and email information
3. **Given** I'm logged in, **When** I ask "Mera naam batao", **Then** I receive my name in the response

### User Story 3 - Persistent Chat Experience (Priority: P2)

As a user, I want my chat conversations to persist across sessions and browser refreshes so that I can continue conversations seamlessly without losing context.

**Why this priority**: Critical for maintaining a good user experience where users can return to previous conversations and the chatbot maintains context of previous interactions.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by starting a conversation, refreshing the page, and verifying that the conversation history is preserved, delivering continuity value.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I've had a conversation with the chatbot, **When** I refresh the page, **Then** I can see the previous messages in the chat window
2. **Given** I've had a conversation yesterday, **When** I log in today, **Then** I can access my previous conversations
3. **Given** I have multiple conversations, **When** I switch between them, **Then** each conversation maintains its own context

---

### User Story 4 - Visual Chat Interface Integration (Priority: P3)

As a user, I want a floating chatbot icon that appears when I'm logged in so that I can access the AI assistant without cluttering the main UI.

**Why this priority**: Improves UX by providing easy access to the chatbot without interfering with the main application interface, following modern chatbot UI patterns.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by logging in and verifying the chatbot icon appears, clicking it opens the chat window, delivering accessibility value.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I'm logged in, **When** I visit any page, **Then** I see a floating chatbot icon in the bottom-right corner
2. **Given** I see the chatbot icon, **When** I click it, **Then** a chat window opens with a clean, modern interface
3. **Given** I have an open chat window, **When** I click outside it, **Then** the window closes without losing conversation context

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user sends a malformed natural language command that the AI cannot interpret?
- How does the system handle requests for tasks that don't exist or belong to other users?
- What happens when the AI processing service is unavailable or returns an error?
- How does the system handle multilingual requests when the AI doesn't understand the language?
- What happens when a user tries to perform operations without proper authentication?
