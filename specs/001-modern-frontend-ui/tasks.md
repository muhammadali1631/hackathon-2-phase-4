# Tasks: Modern Frontend UI for Todo Application

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-modern-frontend-ui/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: No explicit testing requirements in the feature specification - tests are not included.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Web app**: `frontend/` at repository root
- Paths shown below follow the plan.md structure

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure

- [X] T001 Create frontend project structure per implementation plan
- [X] T002 Initialize Next.js 16+ project with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and required dependencies

- [X] T004 [P] Set up font configuration with Inter font from Google Fonts
- [X] T005 [P] Install and configure Lucide React icons library

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3+)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 → P2 → P3)
- **Polish (Final Phase)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Depends on US1 (auth) - Requires authentication to access tasks
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Depends on US1 (auth) and US2 (task display) - Requires auth and task viewing
- **User Story 4 (P4)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Enhances all stories
- **User Story 5 (P5)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Enhances all stories

### Within Each User Story

- Core implementation before integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority
- User Story 2 depends on User Story 1 (auth) being functional
- User Story 3 depends on User Story 1 (auth) and User Story 2 (task display)

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- All components within a user story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members (except where dependencies exist)

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all components for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Create login page component in frontend/app/login/page.tsx"
Task: "Create signup page component in frontend/app/signup/page.tsx"
Task: "Create login form component in frontend/components/auth/login-form.tsx"
Task: "Create signup form component in frontend/components/auth/signup-form.tsx"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Stories 1 and 2 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (Authentication)
4. Complete Phase 4: User Story 2 (Task viewing and management)
5. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Stories 1 and 2 together independently
6. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
3. Add User Story 2 → Test with US1 → Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
4. Add User Story 3 → Test with US1+US2 → Deploy/Demo
5. Add User Story 4 → Test with all previous → Deploy/Demo
6. Add User Story 5 → Test with all previous → Deploy/Demo
7. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (Authentication)
   - Developer B: Begin User Story 2 (Task management) - depends on US1 completion
   - Developer C: User Story 4 (Responsive/Theme) - can work in parallel
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [US1], [US2], etc. label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- User Story 2 has dependency on User Story 1 (auth required)
- User Story 3 has dependencies on User Stories 1 and 2
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
