# Research Document: Modern Frontend UI for Todo Application

**Feature**: 001-modern-frontend-ui
**Date**: 2026-01-05
**Status**: Complete

## Resolved Clarifications

### Testing Approach
**Decision**: Use Jest for unit testing and React Testing Library for component testing
**Rationale**: These are the standard testing libraries for React/Next.js applications that provide comprehensive testing capabilities while aligning with the technology stack requirements
**Alternatives considered**: Cypress (end-to-end), Storybook (component development), Vitest (faster alternative) - Jest + React Testing Library chosen for their widespread adoption and comprehensive feature set

## Technology Decisions

### Layout Choice
**Decision**: Responsive sidebar that collapses to hamburger on mobile (better for productivity feel, inspired by Linear/Notion)
**Rationale**: Provides consistent navigation on desktop while optimizing screen real estate on mobile; familiar pattern for productivity applications
**Alternatives considered**: Top navigation bar, bottom navigation (mobile only) - Sidebar chosen for productivity app feel

### Font Selection
**Decision**: Inter (widely available via Google Fonts, excellent readability, modern feel)
**Rationale**: Excellent readability, modern aesthetic, widely supported, and specifically mentioned in user requirements
**Alternatives considered**: Satoshi - Inter chosen for broader availability and proven readability in productivity apps

### Icon Library
**Decision**: Lucide (more modern stroke styles, better variety for task icons)
**Rationale**: Clean, consistent design language, lightweight, good variety of icons suitable for task management, aligns with modern UI aesthetic
**Alternatives considered**: Heroicons - Lucide chosen for more extensive icon set and modern stroke-based design

### Task View
**Decision**: Hybrid: List on mobile, elegant cards on desktop with subtle hover depth
**Rationale**: Optimizes for different interaction patterns and screen sizes; cards provide better visual hierarchy on desktop while lists are more efficient on mobile
**Alternatives considered**: Pure list view, pure card view - Hybrid approach chosen for optimal UX across devices

### Add Task Button
**Decision**: FAB on mobile, prominent header button on desktop
**Rationale**: Follows platform conventions (FAB is standard on mobile), provides optimal accessibility and discoverability on both platforms
**Alternatives considered**: Always FAB, Always header button - Contextual approach chosen for better UX

### Animations
**Decision**: Pure Tailwind + CSS transitions only (faster, no extra dependency)
**Rationale**: Aligns with constraint of no unnecessary dependencies, provides smooth animations while maintaining performance, consistent with Tailwind-first approach
**Alternatives considered**: Framer Motion - CSS transitions chosen to maintain simplicity and avoid extra dependency

### Empty State
**Decision**: Tasteful SVG illustration with welcoming text (inspired by Notion)
**Rationale**: Provides visual interest while maintaining the premium aesthetic; aligns with user requirement for "delightful" experience
**Alternatives considered**: Text-only, complex illustration - Minimal SVG chosen for balance of visual appeal and simplicity

## Design System Foundation

### Tailwind Configuration
- Custom color palette: Neutral tones with subtle primary accent (e.g., slate for neutral, indigo for primary)
- Spacing scale: Consistent 4px grid system (0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, 64)
- Border radius: Consistent values (4px, 8px, 12px, 16px) for cohesive look
- Shadows: Subtle shadow scale for depth (xs, sm, md, lg) for modern aesthetic
- Typography: Inter font with appropriate heading and body scales

### Component Hierarchy
- Atomic: Base elements (Button, Input, Checkbox, etc.)
- Molecules: Combined elements (LoginForm, TaskItem, etc.)
- Organisms: Complex components (TaskList, Header, Sidebar, etc.)
- Templates: Layout structures
- Pages: Complete views

## Accessibility Strategy

### WCAG AA Compliance
- Proper semantic HTML structure
- Sufficient color contrast ratios
- Keyboard navigation support
- ARIA labels for interactive elements
- Focus management in modals and forms
- Screen reader compatibility

## Performance Optimization

### Loading States
- Skeleton UI for task lists during data fetching
- Optimistic updates for task completion
- Proper loading indicators for all async operations
- Next.js loading states (loading.tsx) for route transitions

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-first approach with progressive enhancement
- Consistent breakpoints (sm: 640px, md: 768px, lg: 1024px, xl: 1280px)
- Touch-friendly targets (minimum 44px)
- Appropriate spacing adjustments across devices
