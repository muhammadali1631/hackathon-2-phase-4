## PROMPT_TEXT
--title "Fixed Chat API Issues" --stage "green" --feature "002-ai-chatbot-cohere"

## RESPONSE_TEXT
Successfully identified and fixed multiple issues with the chat API, including router configuration, authentication logic, JWT error handling, datetime timezone issues, and Cohere model deprecation.

## OUTCOME_IMPACT
The chat API is now fully functional with working authentication, conversation management, database persistence, and AI-powered responses. Both the chat endpoint and conversations endpoint work correctly.

## TESTS_SUMMARY
Multiple tests performed including user registration, chat functionality, conversation listing, and database verification.

## FILES_SUMMARY
- backend/src/api/chat.py: Fixed router prefix and path parameters
- backend/src/services/chat_service.py: Updated Cohere model and tool results handling
- backend/auth.py: Fixed JWT error handling

## NEXT_PROMPTS
Continue with frontend integration, add additional tool integrations, implement rate limiting

## REFLECTION_NOTE
The main issue was a combination of configuration errors and deprecated model usage rather than fundamental logic problems.

## EVALUATION NOTES
Failure modes observed: Some background processes had exit code issues but were cleaned up appropriately.
Next experiment: Implement better error handling for Cohere API model deprecation.
