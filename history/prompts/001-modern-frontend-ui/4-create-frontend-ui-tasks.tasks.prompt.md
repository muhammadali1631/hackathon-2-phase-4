## Prompt

```
$ARGUMENTS
```

## Response snapshot

Created comprehensive task list for the Modern Frontend UI feature (001-modern-frontend-ui). The tasks are organized by user story following the priority order from the original specification:

- Phase 1: Setup tasks for project initialization
- Phase 2: Foundational tasks for core infrastructure
- Phase 3: User Story 1 - Authenticate and Access Dashboard (P1)
- Phase 4: User Story 2 - View and Manage Tasks (P1)
- Phase 5: User Story 3 - Create and Edit Tasks (P2)
- Phase 6: User Story 4 - Responsive Design and Dark Mode (P2)
- Phase 7: User Story 5 - Loading States and Accessibility (P3)
- Phase 8: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

The tasks follow the required format with:
- Sequential task IDs (T001, T002, etc.)
- Parallel markers [P] for tasks that can run concurrently
- User story markers [US1], [US2], etc. for traceability
- Specific file paths for each implementation task
- Dependencies and execution order clearly defined
- MVP strategy focusing on User Stories 1 and 2

Each user story is designed to be independently implementable and testable, with proper dependencies noted.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete task list created for frontend UI implementation
- 🧪 Tests: none (no explicit testing requirements in spec)
- 📁 Files: Created specs/001-modern-frontend-ui/tasks.md
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for implementation with /sp.implement
- 🧠 Reflection: Tasks are well-structured and ready for development

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: none
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): All tasks follow required format
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Begin implementation with /sp.implement
