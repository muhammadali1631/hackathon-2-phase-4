## Prompt

```
Modern & Best-in-Class Frontend UI for Hackathon Phase 2 Todo Full-Stack Web Application
Target audience: Hackathon judges evaluating visual polish, UX excellence, and modern design implementation; end-users expecting a delightful, professional Todo experience
Focus: Build a visually stunning, highly polished, modern, and intuitive Next.js frontend UI that feels like a top-tier 2026 productivity app, while strictly adhering to spec-driven development and the defined tech stack
Success criteria:

UI looks and feels premium, modern, and professional – comparable to apps like Todoist, Notion, or Linear
Clean, minimalist aesthetic with excellent use of whitespace, subtle shadows, rounded corners, and smooth micro-interactions
Perfect Tailwind CSS implementation with consistent design tokens (colors, spacing, typography, border-radius)
Fully responsive across mobile, tablet, and desktop (mobile-first approach with flawless breakpoints)
Dark mode support (automatic via prefers-color-scheme + manual toggle)
Smooth loading states, skeleton UI for task list, and optimistic updates for task actions
Accessible design: proper ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, focus states, and color contrast (WCAG AA compliant)
Beautiful authentication flow: centered login/signup forms with subtle animations and error handling
Dashboard layout: clean sidebar (optional on mobile) or top navigation, hero section for empty state, prominent "Add Task" button (floating or fixed)
Task list: elegant card-based or list view with hover effects, checkbox for completion (smooth strike-through animation), due date badges, priority indicators (if extendable later)
Task form: modal or full-page with auto-focus on title, rich description support (markdown preview optional but clean textarea)
All components reusable, consistent, and built from atomic design principles in /components
Entire UI generated via Claude Code using references to @specs/ui/components.md, @specs/ui/pages.md, and @specs/agents/ui-agent.md
Zero layout shifts, fast perceived performance with Next.js Image/font optimization
Feels instantly familiar yet delightfully modern – judges say "wow, this looks production-ready"

Constraints:

Technology locked: Next.js 16+ (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS only
No third-party UI libraries (no Shadcn/ui, DaisyUI, Headless UI, Radix, etc.) – everything built with pure Tailwind
No custom CSS files – all styling via Tailwind classes
No inline styles allowed
No manual coding – all UI must be generated via precise Claude Code prompts referencing specs
Must follow frontend/CLAUDE.md guidelines exactly (server components default, client only where needed)
Better Auth integration must remain clean and unobtrusive in UI
API calls via centralized /lib/api.ts with JWT handling
Fonts: Use modern system stack or Google Fonts (e.g., Inter or Satoshi for premium feel)

Not building:

Backend logic or API routes
Database or auth backend implementation
Advanced animations library (Framer Motion allowed only if minimal and tasteful – prefer CSS transitions)
Complex features like drag-and-drop reordering, real-time collaboration, or tags (Phase 3+)
Custom illustrations or icons beyond simple SVG or Heroicons/Lucide (keep icon usage tasteful)

Design inspiration (for Claude to reference):

Linear.app (clean task cards, hover states)
Notion (empty states, typography)
Todoist (task completion animation, mobile experience)
Arc browser (subtle depth, rounded aesthetics)
Apple Notes (simplicity, whitespace)

Final note: The UI must not just be functional – it must impress visually and emotionally. Every detail (spacing, alignment, color choice, hover/focus states) must reflect intentional, high-quality design decisions that make the app feel premium and modern in 2026.
```

## Response snapshot

Created comprehensive specification for the Modern Frontend UI feature (001-modern-frontend-ui). The spec includes:

- 5 prioritized user stories covering authentication, task management, creation/editing, responsive design, and accessibility
- 10 functional requirements with unique identifiers
- 2 key entities (User and Task)
- 8 measurable success criteria
- Quality checklist confirming all requirements are met

The specification follows the template structure and focuses on user value without implementation details. All acceptance scenarios are defined with Given/When/Then format, and edge cases are identified.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete feature specification created for modern frontend UI
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: Created specs/001-modern-frontend-ui/spec.md and specs/001-modern-frontend-ui/checklists/requirements.md
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for planning phase with /sp.plan
- 🧠 Reflection: Specification is comprehensive and ready for the planning phase

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: none
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): All validation checks passed
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Begin planning phase with /sp.plan
