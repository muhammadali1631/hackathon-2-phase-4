## Prompt

```
Implementation Plan for Modern & Best-in-Class Frontend UI
Create:

Detailed UI architecture sketch (folder structure, component hierarchy, page routes)
Design system foundation (Tailwind config with custom colors, typography, spacing scale, border-radius, shadows)
Component library breakdown (atomic to composite components)
Page-by-page wireframe description referencing visual inspirations
Dark mode implementation strategy
Accessibility and performance optimization plan

Decisions needing documentation:

Layout choice: Sidebar (desktop) + bottom nav (mobile) vs top navigation bar → Choose responsive sidebar that collapses to hamburger on mobile (better for productivity feel, inspired by Linear/Notion)
Font selection: Inter vs Satoshi → Inter (widely available via Google Fonts, excellent readability, modern feel)
Icon library: Heroicons vs Lucide → Lucide (more modern stroke styles, better variety for task icons)
Task view: Card-based vs pure list → Hybrid: List on mobile, elegant cards on desktop with subtle hover depth
Add Task button: Floating action button (FAB) vs fixed header button → FAB on mobile, prominent header button on desktop
Animations: Pure CSS transitions vs minimal Framer Motion → Pure Tailwind + CSS transitions only (faster, no extra dependency)
Empty state: Illustrative (custom SVG) vs text-only → Tasteful SVG illustration with welcoming text (inspired by Notion)

Testing strategy (validation against success criteria):

Visual review: Compare generated screenshots/components to reference images from Linear, Todoist, Notion
Responsiveness: Test on mobile/tablet/desktop breakpoints, no layout shifts
Dark mode: Toggle and prefers-color-scheme detection works perfectly
Accessibility: Lighthouse audit for WCAG AA (contrast, ARIA, keyboard nav)
Loading/performance: Skeleton states appear instantly, optimistic updates feel snappy
Auth flow: Login/signup forms centered, subtle fade-in, error messages elegant
Micro-interactions: Hover states, checkbox animations, focus rings all polished
Overall polish: Manual review – does it feel "wow, production-ready in 2026"?

Technical details:

Use spec-concurrent approach: Generate and refine UI components while referencing @specs/ui/* and @specs/agents/ui-agent.md iteratively
All styling decisions documented in tailwind.config.js (extend theme with custom palette: neutral tones with subtle primary accent)
Follow Next.js App Router conventions strictly (layout.tsx, page.tsx, loading.tsx, error.tsx)
Centralized state management minimal (React context only if needed for theme/auth)
API integration via /lib/api.ts with proper JWT attachment and error handling UI

Organize by phases:

Foundation → Set up Next.js project, Tailwind config, design tokens, fonts, dark mode base, icon setup
Authentication UI → Login/Signup pages with beautiful centered forms, Better Auth integration, error/success states
Core Components → Build atomic components (Button, Input, Checkbox, Card, Modal, Skeleton) with premium polish
Task Components → TaskCard/TaskItem, TaskForm (modal), EmptyState, AddTask FAB
Layout & Pages → Root layout, protected Dashboard page, responsive navigation
Polish & Optimizations → Loading states, skeletons, optimistic updates, micro-interactions, accessibility fixes
Final Review → Iterate based on visual comparison to inspirations, ensure "delightful and modern" feel

This plan ensures the frontend will be visually stunning, highly professional, and perfectly aligned with the premium 2026 productivity app vision – all while remaining fully spec-driven and constraint-compliant.

## Response snapshot

Created comprehensive implementation plan for the Modern Frontend UI feature (001-modern-frontend-ui). The plan includes:

- Detailed technical context with technology stack and constraints
- Constitution compliance check ensuring all principles are followed
- Complete project structure with frontend directory layout
- Research document resolving all clarifications and technology decisions
- Data model defining User and Task entities with relationships
- Quickstart guide for development workflow
- API contracts for authentication and task management endpoints
- Agent context updated in CLAUDE.md with new technologies

All planning artifacts are complete and ready for the task generation phase.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete implementation plan created for modern frontend UI
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: Created plan.md, research.md, data-model.md, quickstart.md, contracts/api-contracts.md, updated CLAUDE.md
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for task generation with /sp.tasks
- 🧠 Reflection: Plan is comprehensive and aligned with constitution requirements

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: none
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): All constitution checks passed
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Generate tasks with /sp.tasks
