## Response snapshot

Successfully completed the implementation of the AI Todo Chatbot Integration (Cohere-Powered) feature. The implementation includes:

### Backend Implementation
1. **Models**:
   - Created `Conversation` and `Message` models with proper relationships
   - Enhanced `User` model with `last_chat_interaction` field
   - Added Pydantic models for chat functionality

2. **Services**:
   - Built `ChatService` for conversation management
   - Developed `ToolsService` with MCP-compatible tools (add_task, list_tasks, complete_task, delete_task, update_task, get_user_profile)
   - Created `CohereRunner` class for AI integration and tool execution

3. **API Endpoints**:
   - Implemented `/api/{user_id}/chat` endpoint for natural language processing
   - Added `/api/{user_id}/conversations` endpoint for conversation management
   - Ensured JWT authentication and user isolation

4. **Database Integration**:
   - Updated models to include conversation and message tables
   - Added proper foreign key relationships
   - Implemented conversation history loading with limits

### Frontend Implementation
1. **Components**:
   - Created `ChatWindow.tsx` with modern UI, conversation sidebar, and messaging interface
   - Developed `ChatbotIcon.tsx` with floating action button and pulse animation
   - Added typing indicators and smooth scrolling

2. **Services**:
   - Built `chatApi.ts` with functions for sending messages and managing conversations
   - Integrated with existing authentication system

### Key Features Delivered
- **Natural Language Processing**: Users can manage tasks with commands like "Add task buy milk" or "Show pending tasks"
- **Profile Queries**: Users can ask for profile information in English or Urdu
- **Persistent Conversations**: Chat history preserved across sessions with database storage
- **Secure Access**: JWT authentication with strict user data isolation
- **Modern UI**: Floating chatbot icon with modal interface and smooth interactions
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of API failures and edge cases
