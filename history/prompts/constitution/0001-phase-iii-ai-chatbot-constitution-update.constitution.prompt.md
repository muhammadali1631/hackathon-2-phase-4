## Prompt

Project: Phase III – AI Todo Chatbot Integration into Existing Full-Stack Todo Application

Core principles:
- Full agentic, spec-driven development with zero manual coding – all implementation via Claude Code + Spec-Kit references
- Seamless integration into the existing Phase II backend (FastAPI + Neon PostgreSQL + Better Auth + JWT) without breaking any current functionality
- Stateless architecture for scalability: conversation state persisted only in database (conversations + messages tables)
- Natural language chatbot that fully controls task management (add, list, complete, delete, update) and provides user profile information (id, email, name, createdAt)
- Use Cohere API as the primary LLM backend for agent reasoning, tool calling, and response generation (instead of OpenAI)
- Adapt OpenAI Agents SDK patterns and code structure to work with Cohere API (use Cohere's tool-calling capabilities, structured outputs, and chat completions)
- MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools remain the standardized interface for agent-tool interaction – expose all task and user operations as MCP-compatible tools
- Secure: All chat operations protected by JWT (user_id from token), strict task/user isolation, no data leakage
- Friendly, contextual, and multilingual responses (English + Urdu support when relevant) with action confirmations and graceful error handling

Key standards:
- Chat endpoint: POST /api/{user_id}/chat (accepts conversation_id optional, message required) – returns conversation_id, response, tool_calls
- MCP Tools must exactly match spec: add_task, list_tasks, complete_task, delete_task, update_task + new get_user_profile
- All tools require user_id (from JWT) and enforce ownership
- Conversation history fetched from DB on every request, user/assistant messages stored after processing
- Agent behavior: Understand natural language intents (e.g., "Add task buy milk", "Show pending tasks", "Mera profile batao", "Mark task 4 complete", "Delete the old one")
- Use Cohere API key via environment variable COHERE_API_KEY
- Cohere model: Use latest suitable model (e.g., command-r-plus or command-r) with tool calling enabled
- Pydantic models for strict request/response validation
- Error handling: Return helpful messages for task not found, invalid input, auth failure (401)
- All queries filtered by authenticated user_id from JWT middleware (reuse existing get_current_user)
- Swagger docs updated to include /api/{user_id}/chat endpoint
- Frontend: Integrate OpenAI ChatKit (or compatible Cohere-compatible chat UI) in existing Next.js app – call backend /api/{user_id}/chat
- Domain allowlist: Prepare for OpenAI ChatKit hosted mode (even if using Cohere backend) – document setup in README

Constraints:
- Existing Phase II stack locked: FastAPI, SQLModel, Neon PostgreSQL, Better Auth + JWT
- LLM switch: Use Cohere API exclusively (no OpenAI calls) – adapt OpenAI Agents SDK patterns to Cohere's chat/tool-calling API
- No new external libraries beyond Cohere SDK (cohere-python) and Official MCP SDK
- Environment variables: Add COHERE_API_KEY; reuse BETTER_AUTH_SECRET, NEON_DB_URL
- Stateless server: No in-memory session – all state in DB
- Public auth routes (signup/signin) remain unchanged; chat endpoint fully protected
- No real-time (WebSockets) – single-turn stateless requests
- No advanced features like multi-agent swarms, voice, or image generation (keep to text-based task management + profile)
- Timeline: Integrate without disrupting Phase II task CRUD UI/API

Success criteria:
- Chatbot fully manages tasks via natural language: add, list (with filters), complete, delete, update – with friendly confirmations
- User profile queries work: "Mera email kya hai?" → returns id, email, name, createdAt
- Conversation context preserved across requests via DB persistence – resumes after server restart
- All operations secure: JWT required, user_id enforced, no cross-user access
- Agent uses Cohere for reasoning/tool selection – successful tool calls visible in response (tool_calls array)
- Endpoint returns correct response format: {conversation_id, response, tool_calls}
- Full integration: Existing frontend can add ChatKit UI tab/page calling backend chat endpoint
- Judges confirm: "Seamless Phase III upgrade – agentic, secure, scalable, Cohere-powered, fully spec-driven"
- Zero regressions in Phase II functionality (task CRUD, auth)
- Runs locally with docker-compose (frontend + backend + Neon)

Final deliverables:
- Updated monorepo: New specs in /specs/agents/ and /specs/skills/ for chatbot, MCP tools, Cohere integration
- Backend additions: /api/{user_id}/chat endpoint, Cohere agent runner, MCP tools implementation
- DB schema extensions: Conversation and Message tables
- Frontend: ChatKit integration in Next.js (new page/route) with JWT attachment
- README updates: Setup Cohere API key, domain allowlist for ChatKit, full run instructions
- Complete traceable history of spec-driven Claude Code prompts (@specs references) demonstrating agentic workflow
- Working end-to-end: Natural language chat controls entire Todo app + user info

This constitution ensures a production-grade, Cohere-powered AI chatbot that perfectly extends the existing full-stack Todo app – secure, scalable, and impressively agentic. Every detail is covered for hackathon excellence.

## Response snapshot

Updated the project constitution to reflect the Phase III AI Todo Chatbot Integration requirements. The new constitution includes:
- Major version update from 1.0.0 to 2.0.0 to reflect significant changes
- Added AI-specific requirements sections (AI Agent Architecture, Cohere LLM Integration, MCP Tools Standardization, Stateless Conversation Architecture)
- Updated existing principles to incorporate AI/LLM aspects while maintaining core spec-driven development principles
- Preserved all security and data isolation requirements for AI operations
- Maintained the zero manual coding mandate and spec-driven approach for AI implementation

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Major update to constitution reflecting Phase III AI chatbot integration requirements
- 🧪 Tests: No tests needed for constitution update
- 📁 Files: Updated .specify/memory/constitution.md with new AI-focused principles
- 🔁 Next prompts: Implementation of AI chatbot according to updated constitution
- 🧠 Reflection: Successfully integrated AI requirements while maintaining core development principles

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Not applicable
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Not applicable
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Begin implementing AI chatbot features according to updated constitution
