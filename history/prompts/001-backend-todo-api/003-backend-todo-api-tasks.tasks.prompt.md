## Prompt

$ARGUMENTS

## Response snapshot

# Implementation Tasks: Backend Todo API

**Feature**: 001-backend-todo-api
**Generated**: 2026-01-06
**Spec**: specs/001-backend-todo-api/spec.md

## Implementation Strategy

**MVP First**: Implement User Story 1 (Create Tasks) with minimal authentication and database setup to create a working foundation, then incrementally add features.

**Delivery Approach**: Phase 1-2 establish foundational infrastructure, then Phase 3+ implement user stories in priority order (P1, P2, P3), with Phase 7 for polish and integration.

## Dependencies

User Story 1 (Create Tasks) → User Story 2 (View Tasks) → User Story 3 (Update Tasks) → User Story 4 (Delete Tasks) → User Story 5 (View Individual Task)

## Parallel Execution Examples

- Phase 1: Setup can run in parallel (creating project structure, installing dependencies, setting up environment)
- Phase 2: Authentication and database setup can be developed separately but integrated together
- Phase 6: Error handling can be applied across all endpoints in parallel

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Project Initialization)

### Goal
Establish project structure and basic configuration for the FastAPI backend application.

### Independent Test
Verify that the project structure exists and dependencies can be installed successfully.

### Tasks

- [ ] T001 Create backend directory structure: `backend/main.py`, `backend/models.py`, `backend/db.py`, `backend/auth.py`, `backend/routes/tasks.py`
- [ ] T002 Create .env file with required environment variables: BETTER_AUTH_SECRET, BETTER_AUTH_URL, NEON_DB_URL
- [ ] T003 Install required dependencies: fastapi, uvicorn, sqlmodel, python-dotenv, pyjwt
- [ ] T004 [P] Initialize basic FastAPI app in main.py with basic CORS configuration
- [ ] T005 Set up basic project configuration and ensure project runs with `uvicorn main:app --reload`

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

### Goal
Implement core infrastructure components that all user stories depend on: authentication middleware and database models.

### Independent Test
Verify that JWT authentication can extract user_id from a valid token and that the database models can be created and connected.

### Tasks

- [ ] T006 Implement database connection setup in db.py with Neon Serverless PostgreSQL using SQLModel
- [ ] T007 [P] Create Task model in models.py with all required fields (id, title, description, completed, user_id, created_at, updated_at)
- [ ] T008 [P] Create Pydantic request/response models for Task (TaskCreate, TaskUpdate, TaskResponse) in models.py
- [ ] T009 Implement JWT authentication middleware in auth.py to verify tokens and extract user_id
- [ ] T010 [P] Create database session dependency for FastAPI applications in db.py
